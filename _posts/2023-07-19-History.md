This is where I will record major events so that one day we can all reflect on the timeline and realize how shitty of a story we are in. Trust me, it will be funny one day.

# 07/19/2023 - Website launch

Nothing cool. This is just a mark of when recording has started. We can include past events too, but I think it would be better to start at this scope.

# 07/25/2023 - Twitter's Intial Rebranding to "X"

No comment. Opinons are done to death about this. This mention just exists to see where it will go later.

# 08/04/2023 - Mark Margolis Passes Away

Margolis passed at the age of 83 due to complications from an illness. Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul were some of my favorite TV shows, so it's a shame to hear he has moved on.
