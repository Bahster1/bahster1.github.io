This is an Electron app that can run on Windows, Mac, and Linux, but unfortunately weighs as much as a CoD update and hogs RAM like a bitch. However, if you don't mind that, you can see pink fictional characters meander a grass field in search of braincells. Please enjoy this bloated piece of malware.
