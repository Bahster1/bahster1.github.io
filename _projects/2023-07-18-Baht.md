Everyone and their dog has a Discord bot at this point, so here is mine. It's main shtick is that it assigns each participating user a social credit score that can be added to, subtracted from, or set directly by admins in the server. Sometimes it works, and other times it shits itself over large integers. I haven't updated this in a while so I am not even sure if the newest version of Discord.py will be compatible but who knows.
