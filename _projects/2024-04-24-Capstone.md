# Introduction

Machines that are subject to normal wear and tear require regular maintenance to function properly. 
However, current preventative maintenance regimes can be costly if a machine is capable of operating for a longer period of time. 
Machine learning models can be a potential solution to ensuring machines are maintained at the right time before they break down.
Machine learning models can track past machine operation history to accurately predict when it may break down so that it is only tended to when it matters most. 

All code made for this project can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Bahster1/Capstone) repository.

# Methods

In this project, there are two explored methods for accomplishing this task: a supervised and an unsupervised machine learning model. 

Supervised machine learning models require the data points they are given to be labeled; in the context of this task, this means machine error states need to be recorded and attributed to a machine's readings at any given state. 

Unsupervised machine learning models, in contrast to supervised models, do not require the input data to be labeled. The machine learning model will have to analyze trends to make an educated guess as to when a machine is failing. 

Each model with the exception of the isolation forest have been cross validated using k-fold cross validation. This ensures the models select the best parameters to get the best accuracy in predicting a machine's state. 

### Supervised Learning Models

The supervised machine learning models explored are K-nearest neighbor and decision tree classifiers, along with a feed-forward neural network.
The data used to train and test these models can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification).

Each model had two cases to consider: the multi-class case, in which they need to predict what state a machine will be in at any given moment, and the binary class case, in which the models need to predict if the machine will return an error or not in any given state. Below are the results of their predictions.

### Unsupervised Learning Model

The unsupervised machine learning model used for this task is an isolation forest. The isolation forest model will, put simply, attempt to identify outliers in a dataset and will mark identified points. 

The data used to train and test this model can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/improving-naval-vessel-condition-through-machine).

Below is the result of this model, in which anamolous points are marked in red:

# Conclusion

The dataset used for the supervised models is not from a real machine, instead, it is a spoofed dataset. Supposedly, it is meant to mimic real machine behavior in industry, but without a real set of data to test these models on, this study is not thorough in its investigation. 

The dataset used for the unsupervised model is a real world recording of a navy vessel, however, the tuning for the model can improve significantly. It is also not known what points are actually anomalous, so it is difficult to judge if the model is working correctly or not without additional background knowledge of the data.
